Use this template as a base for your contribution to the __moonlight-chrome__ project. When making changes, we recommend you use the `git flow` pattern, meaning creating a dedicated branch for your feature or bugfix (something like _feature/feature_ or _bugfix/issuefix_), and then posting a pull request comparing from `your-fork:branch` to `moonlight-chrome:master`.

Here you can add some description of your pull request: what does it do? Why do you think it's a good feature?

This pull request features:
- Added: something
- Fixed: something

Ending your pull request, you can add a screenshot of your feature in action. You could also comment your individual commits in order to explain your changes and decisions.
